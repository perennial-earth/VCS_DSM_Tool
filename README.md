# README: CN0137: Quantifying Organic Carbon Stocks using Digital Soil Mapping: Calibration, Validation, and Uncertainty Estimation

## Overview

The **CN0137 Tool** provides protocols for using **Digital Soil Mapping (DSM)** as a quantification technology in Verified Carbon Standard (VCS) Agricultural Land Management (ALM) methodologies, e.g. VM0042 and VM0032. It focuses on **calibration, validation, and uncertainty estimation** to quantify **Soil Organic Carbon (SOC) stocks** and/or stock changes. This tool ensures rigorous, science-backed quantification for agricultural land management projects while maintaining flexibility for real-world applications.

## What is Appendix 6?

**Appendix 6: Example Uncertainty Calculation** is a supplementary document that demonstrates the process of computing uncertainty in SOC stock estimates. This appendix provides detailed step-by-step methodologies for:
- Estimating the variance of SOC stock measurements
- Propagating uncertainty through DSM-based predictions
- Applying uncertainty adjustments in accordance with VCS methodology requirements

This document is a key resource for ensuring that projects following CN0137 adhere to best practices in **uncertainty quantification** and **model validation**.
